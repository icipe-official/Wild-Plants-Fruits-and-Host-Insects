        </h2>

        <p>
          This Platform enable users to examine the data of the wild fruits of
          Kenya and their associated insect fauna, specifically those that use
          fruits in their breeding cycles.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          Although the primary focus of our study was on fruits as larval
          habitats of fruit flies (Tephritidae), particularly those of economic
          importance, many other insects exploit fruits. And while there is a
          large body of information on the associations of insects with the
          leafy and woody parts of plants, there is little data available on the
          guild of insects exploiting fruits, either as pulp or seed feeders, or
          as parasitoids of species from these two groups. This is especially
          true for Africa. In addition to tephritids, by including in the
          platform records of the many other insect groups feeding within fruits
          we hoped to provide the baseline information necessary for a fuller
          appreciation of the possibilities available for studying insect-fruit
          interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope that the platform will also have value when used as a field
          guide to the fruits of Kenya and other parts of eastern Africa. Fruits
          are an important food for many species of animals, including primates,
          bats, and birds, and ornithologists and mammalogists should benefit
          from using this platform. Of course, fruits are the vessels in which
          seeds develop, and plant species have evolved many strategies for
          protecting and dispersing their seeds. Many edible fruits are brightly
          colored (often red, orange, or yellow) and easy to locate. For these
          fruits, whose bright colors attract the attention of fruit-eating
          animals, seed dispersal often results from fruit consumption. Seeds
          then pass through the vertebrate gut and are deposited in feces, or
          are swallowed and regurgitated; either way at some distance from
          parent plants. Duller fruits (brown, black) are more difficult to see
          and are less likely to be fed upon by diurnal (daylight-active)
          animals. These fruits are often eaten by nocturnal fruit bats and
          other night-active mammals (e.g. bush babies, palm civets). Fruit bats
          lack the highly developed sonar of their insect-feeding cousins and,
          accordingly, they are not particularly agile fliers in habitats with
          dense foliage. Plant taxa that have caulicarpous fruits (i.e. fruits
          developing on inflorescences that appear on older wood [trunk or
          limbs]) present food that is easily accessed by fruit bats. The most
          familiar examples of this are the figs, but cauliflory has evolved in
          many other plant families (e.g. Annonaceae), particularly in the
          tropics, where fruit bats are common. For the generalist interested in
          natural history, knowledge of the fruits will add to the pleasures of
          the outdoor life, and we hope the platform appeals to a wide audience.
          Plants are easier to identify when flowering or fruiting and, while
          flowering specimens are the cornerstone of plant taxonomy, fruits are
          often available when flowers are not. These two features of plants
          complement each other, greatly expanding the season when plants may be
          readily identified in the field.

          <a name="scope_of_the_database" class="anchor"
            >Scope of the database</a
          >
        </h2>

        <p>
          The plant database contains approximately 873 plant types, primarily
          species with some subspecies and varieties. The majority of these
          species are indigenous to Kenya, but the database also encompasses
          certain non-native, species like guava and cultivated species like
          mango. During the early stages of the project, the collection were
          focused on plants likely to attract frugivorous tephritids, which
          skewed the sampling towards fruits with fleshy pulp. Notably, some
          significant plant taxa, including many from the Asteraceae,
          Burseraceae, and Fabaceae families, have fewer species with fleshy
          fruits and were sampled less frequently. Furthermore, our
          concentration was primarily on woody plants, as they typically produce
          a greater abundance of fruits compared to herbaceous plants. While our
          coverage of woody plants wasn't exhaustive, it was substantial,
          encompassing approximately 40% of all species and a significantly
          higher percentage of those with fleshy fruits. This coverage aligns
          closely with the information found in "Kenya Trees Shrubs and Lianas"
          (Beentje 1994), a comprehensive guide for identifying woody plants in
          Kenya. We also extensively sampled certain other plant groups, such as
          the herbaceous Cucurbitaceae and Vitaceae, as well as the parasitic
          Loranthaceae (mistletoes). Additionally, we included representatives
          from specific plant families, like Asteraceae and Acanthaceae, which
          are consumed by different fruit fly groups, some of which feed on
          flower parts while others consume both flowers and fruits.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          Collections were made in many habitat types, the majority in forested
          areas, from the coastal forest mosaic in the east to Mt. Elgon on the
          western border, from the southern forests to Marsabit Mountain in the
          north, and at elevations from sea level to 3125 m.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reared at least 595 insect species from the fruit collections.
          Poorly preserved specimens (mostly moths) that could not be
          definitively identified or assigned to a specific morphospecies were
          not included in the total. Tephritid fruit flies, with 123 species,
          and tortricid and pyralid moths, with 87 and 43 species respectively,
          were the most common frugivores.

          Users select one or more values for each of several character states
          (e.g. fruit color, leaf type, etc.) by clicking on the appropriate
          entries. All selections within a character box are “or”, not “and”,
          selections, making the key inclusive, not exclusive. Say, for example,
          you have made a collection from a single plant species with compound
          leaves that are trifoliolate (three leaflets per leaf), and whose
          fruits include both red and yellow ones. You would select both colors
          in the Fruit color box. If the fruit from your plant is described in
          the literature as being yellow only, selecting red in addition to
          yellow will not eliminate the correct plant from the list generated by
          your query, because you have included yellow. Additionally, clicking
          on trifoliolate in the leaf type box will not exclude the correct
          plant from the results even if it is described in the literature as
          having 3 or 5 leaflets. Submitting a query will return a list of one
          or more plant names. Selecting a plant name from the list brings up
          the data page for that species.

          It is not necessary to select a value for each character state. While
          not selecting a value for one or more character states diminishes the
          strength of your search, you may very well have entered enough values
          for other characters to identify your plant or to narrow the
          possibilities considerably. For example, you may not know whether your

          In the key, we have tried to keep technical terms to a minimum to
          enable non-specialists to use the key. Thus, for example, when
          examining the leaf or leaflet edge or margin, the term “with sharp or
          rounded teeth” includes margins more technically described as
          “dentate”, “serrate” or “crenate”. Many terms in the key are
          represented in the illustrated glossaries. Double-clicking on a term
          will call up the definition and one or more images illustrating it. In
          putting together the glossary we relied on several sources,
          particularly The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms
          (Hickey &amp; King 2000).

        <h3>Illustrated glossaries of plant terms</h3>

        <p>
          An illustrated glossary of botanical terms can be used as a primary
          teaching tool, or referred to when using the multiple-entry key to the
          plants to call up definitions and images of plant structures and
          features. Double-clicking on a term in the key will bring up its
          definition in the glossary. Photographic images illustrating a term
          are accessed by clicking on the “images” button to the right of each
          definition. Some self-evident terms are not illustrated. A general,
          alphabetically arranged glossary is available as are category-related
          glossaries (e.g. terms related to leaf margin characteristics, fruit
          shapes, etc.).

        <p>
          The primary single-volume sources for identification of Kenyan plants
          are Kenya Trees, Shrubs and Lianas (KTSL) (Beentje 1994) and Upland
          Kenya Wildflowers (UKWF) (Agnew &amp; Agnew 1994). In each, a separate
          scheme is used to illustrate the distribution of the plants
          considered. Like its precursor, Dale and Greenway’s (1961) Kenya Trees
          and Shrubs (KTS), KTSL has as its scope Kenyan woody plants but
          increases its coverage by including lianas, which were not covered in
          the former. KTSL follows the distribution map format of the
          multi-volume Flora of Tropical East Africa (FTEA), in which the
          country is divided into 7 large divisions (K1-K7). UKWF, in contrast,
          only includes herbaceous plants found in the uplands of Kenya
          (essentially the southwest quarter of the country, although many of
          the listed plants have wider distributions). In UKWF, an abbreviated
          version of actual place names serves to identify each of 20
          “vegetation districts”. When using the platform, the data page for each
          plant species contains information on its distribution as either one
          or more of the K divisions of KTSL or of the “vegetation districts” of
          UKWF. When necessary, users can click on the “Maps” tab to see which
          parts of the country these divisions refer to.

          The known altitudinal range for each plant is also provided on the
          plant data page. In the CD, distributional data (including altitude)
          of individual plant species sometimes differs from that published in
          FTEA and UKWF. These changes reflect observations made during the
          current project.

          particular insect species are indicated on the Browse Insects pages.

        <!-- <p>
          We have tried to be as accurate as possible when assigning a fruit
          type to a species. For some fleshy fruits, however, based on the
          reference literature we used (mainly UKWF, KTSL and FTEA [see
          explanation of abbreviations below]), it was sometimes not possible to
          decide between a drupe and a berry. In these cases, both are listed on
          a plant species’ page and selecting either in the multiple-entry key
          will lead to the correct plant.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          Fruit size is one of the characteristics of individual plant species
          that appear on its data page. It is also one of the characters found
          in the multiple-entry key. Fruit size is a continuous variable, and to
          keep things manageable, we defined 5 size classes (<10mm, 10-15mm,
          15-25mm, 25-40mm, and >40mm), based on the length of the fruit along
          its longest dimension. Often, more than one fruit size class is listed
          on a fruit data page, each class separated by a semicolon. For
          example, on the data page for the cucurbit
          <em>Oreosyce africana</em> (Cucurbitaceae) two size classes are
          indicated, 10-15mm; 15-25mm. This simply means that mature fruits of
          this species occur in sizes that fall within the limits of the two
          size classes, not necessarily that they range from 10 to 25mm (in fact
          such a case would be rare). A species with fruits from 12-17mm would
          fall in these classes, as would a species whose fruits range from
          10-24mm.

          With few exceptions, digital images of freshly collected fruits and,
          in most cases, associated stem and leaf specimens were made in the
          field. Throughout the project I used either a Fujifilm 2.8 megapixel
          digital camera, a Nikon Coolpix 4300 digital camera, or a Canon IS3S
          digital camera to capture images of fruits. Flash was avoided whenever
          possible to limit high contrast, shadowy images, and to capture
          natural coloration. In most cases, plant specimens were collected with
          a long-arm pruner and arranged on the ground with associated fruits.
          Images of a few infraspecific taxa (subspecies, varieties) are also
          included. Multiple images are usually provided, including wide-angle
          to close-up views of plant specimen, fruit, and flowers (when
          present). A writing pen was placed in the field of view to provide
          scale. The diameter of the pen barrel is approximately 10 mm.
          Photographs of entire plants were seldom made, because of the
          difficulty of controlling contrast and avoiding confusing backgrounds.
          In all, 2224 images are included representing 866 of the 928 plant
          taxa collected.

          Because this was a fruit fly project we concentrated on capturing

          tephritid species. Usually, examples of both sexes are available, and
          this is always the case for sexually dimorphic species. Tephritidae,
          and representatives of several other insect taxa that were reared from
          fruits, were held with water and a sugar/yeast diet for 3-4 days.
          Thereafter they were starved for 24 h. They were then transferred to a
          20 x 15 x 2.5 cm Plexiglas (Perspex) cage with a removable pane of
          glass through which photographs were taken. The dull, non-reflective
          underside of an avocado leaf was generally used as background. Sugar
          syrup was dotted on the veins of the leaf. Feeding insects remained
          stationary and were easily photographed. Kodachrome 64 slide film was
          used throughout. The photographic setup consisted of a CANON F1 camera
          body and a 100 mm macro lenses, to which a “12x” Raynox Microexplorer
          supplemental lens was attached. Two weak flashes mounted at either
          ends of a Lepp Macrobracket provided illumination.

          We are indebted to the many individuals and organizations who
          contributed to making the platform. Foremost among these was Glenn
          Sequeira who was responsible for all the software programming. The
          East African Natural History Society (EANHS) gave us permission to use
          the plant descriptions and the map of vegetation districts from Upland
          Kenya Wild Flowers. The National Museums of Kenya (NMK) did the same
          for the map illustrating the K1-K7 distribution zones of Kenya and for
          plant descriptions from Kenya Trees, Shrubs and Lianas. We thank the
          current editor of the Flora of Tropical East Africa series (FTEA),
          Henk Beentje, for allowing us to use descriptions of the small number
          of plants not described in these two books. Millicent Okumu and Peris
          Machera were instrumental in attending to the laboratory handling of
          fruit collections and the rearing of insects from them. Rose Justus,
          Asha Nassor, and Augustus Hare did an excellent job providing similar
          services at our coastal rearing facility. Wilberforce Okeka, Mathias
          Ngonyo, Saidi Chidzinga, and Juliet Muriuki were interpid fruit
          finders and collectors. Karie Darrow of the National Museum of Natural
          History, Washington DC made the dissections of Lepidoptera genitalia.
          The superb images found in the platform of these and many of the adult
          moths are a result of her much appreciated technical skills. Koen Maes
          also photographed some of the Lepidoptera. Matt Buffington, Systematic
          Entomology Laboratory, USDA/ARS, provided invaluable training and help
          with photography of the microhymenoptera, and the quality of these
          images is due largely to his interest and support. We thank Hans
          Herren, the Director, International Centre of Insect Physiology and
          Ecology ICIPE), for providing office space, an indispensable field
          vehicle, and continuing support. Dr. Richard Bagine of the Kenya
          Wildlife Service was very helpful in granting us permission to sample
          fruits within Kenyan national parks.

          Accurate identification of host plants and the various insect species
          that exploit them was basic to developing our database and assigning
          names to specimens and photographs. We greatly appreciate the interest
          and commitment of the following systematists and their respective
          institutions; Marc de Meyer, Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren
          (Tephritidae); Ian White, Natural History Museum, London
          (Tephritidae); Amnon Freidberg, Tel Aviv University (Tephritidae); the
          following scientists, all of Systematic Entomology Laboratory,
          USDA/ARS; David Adamski (Coleophoridae, Stathmopodidae, Gelechioidea);
          John Brown (Tortricidae), Matt Buffington (Figitidae), Mike Gates
          (Eurytomidae), Eric Grissel (Torymidae), Al Norrbom (Tephritidae),
          Chris Thompson (Syrphidae), and Norm Woodley (Stratiomyidae,
          Tachinidae); Scott Miller (Geometridae, Noctuidae, Nolidae, Pyralidae,
          Yponomeutidae) and Wayne Mathis (Heleomyzidae) both of the National
          Museum of Natural History, Washington DC; Koen Maes, National Museums
          of Kenya (Crambidae, Pyralidae); Chris Lyall, Natural History Museum,
          London (Curculionidae); Alexander G. Kirejtshuk, National Academy of
          Sciences, St. Petersburg (Nitidulidae).
