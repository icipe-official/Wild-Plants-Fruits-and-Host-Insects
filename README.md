# Wild Plants, Fruits, and Host Insects BioCollections

Welcome to Wild Plants, Fruits, and Host Insects BioCollections ,a comprehensive digital platform dedicated to exploring and understanding the diverse world of wild fruits and their associated host insects. Our project aims to provide a centralized repository of valuable information about various plant species, their fruits, and the insects that rely on them for their survival.

# About the Project

Our platform is a result of extensive research and data collection on wild plants and their ecological interactions with host insects hosted by icipe. It serves as an invaluable resource for botanists, entomologists, ecologists, researchers, and nature enthusiasts seeking to delve deeper into the intricate relationships between plants and insects in natural ecosystems.
